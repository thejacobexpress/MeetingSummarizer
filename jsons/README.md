There are two files that should be located within this folder that are mentioned in the Python code for this project: credentials.json, which you need to create, and token.json, which is generated by the code automatically.

The credentials.json file is tied to the Google account that is the "sender" for the emails. A unique credentials.json must be created for each individual Google account in order to send emails through the Gmail API. In order to create these credentials, you must create a Google Cloud project, enable the Gmail API, and then generate OAuth 2.0 Credentials (the credentials.json file). Start here: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project

The token.json is generated by the code in order to automatically sign into the Google account specified within credentials.json. In order to generate a token.json file, you must run the project (Main.py) with a monitor attached to sign into your Google account the first time you run the project. This generates the token.json file. After the first run, there is no need to sign into your Google account anymore and the project can be run without a monitor.
